1.Install SCSS in the Project: If you havenâ€™t set up SCSS, install the required package:
npm install sass

2.Create index.scss File
Inside your src folder, create an index.scss file.

Import the Tailwind CSS directives and add any custom SCSS styles as needed.

/* index.scss */

/* Tailwind CSS Directives */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

3.Update Tailwind Configuration
In the tailwind.config.js file, make sure you configure Tailwind to watch for class names in both your React files and your SCSS files:
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", // For React components
    "./src/**/*.scss", // For SCSS files
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};

4.Import index.scss in Your Main File
In your main React file, such as index.js or App.js, import the index.scss file to apply both Tailwind CSS and your custom SCSS styles across the app:
import './index.scss';
